		<h2> Gaming industry </h2>
			Six video game trends transforming the industry include cloud gaming and streaming, digital distribution, business models such as free to play, increased diversity and audience, mobile gaming, and next-generation consoles.
			<br>
			<h3> 1. Action Games </h3>
				<br>
				“Action” is a broad term referring to games that require high reaction speed and strong hand-eye coordination. The player is often under time pressure to overcome physical challenges, including combat, while partaking in activities such as solving puzzles.Popular subgenres of action games include fighting, first-person shooter (FPS), and survival. Early action titles include the Super Mario Bros. series. More recent action series include Assassin’s Creed, Resident Evil, and Saints Row.
				<br>
			<h3> 2. Idle Games </h3>
				<br>
				Idle games, also called incremental games, require little to no interaction. Players progress through basic actions, such as clicking, to receive rewards. Rewards can come in the form of in-game currency or opportunities to build upon their success.For example, players of AdVenture Capitalist start with a lemonade stand, but over time, through minimal actions, they can grow their business into a thriving, lucrative enterprise. Titles: Realm Grinder, Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes, Idle Miner Tycoon, Plantera.

            <h3> 3. Role-Playing Games </h3>
            	<br>
            	Role-playing games (RPGs) often allow players to create customized characters who represent them in a fictional space. The player inhabits the character to interact with companions and others in the game and makes decisions that can lead to rewards such as skill points and inventory. The key characteristics of RPGs include combat, a developing storyline, exploration and discovery, and choices and consequences.An early example of an RPG is 1987’s Dungeon Master. More recent popular RPGs include Final Fantasy XV, Pokémon Yellow, and World of Warcraft. Popular subgenres of RPGs include massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) and sandbox RPGs.
            	<br>
            <h3> 4. Simulation Games </h3>
            	<br>
            	Simulation games, also known as sims, are played in a simulated real-world or fictional experience. Examples of real-life experience sims include flying a fighter plane, cooking like a chef, or driving a truck. A fictional sim might involve taking part in a historical event or living life as an animal. Sims offer gamers authenticity and entertainment at the same time.

                	<br>
                	<h3> EDUCATION SYSTEM IN INDIA </h3>
                  	Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1-8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1-8 is shared between government and privately managed schools in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower (36:66).In the 2011 Census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for males and 65% for females. National Statistical Commission surveyed literacy to be 77.7% in 2017–18, 84.7% for male and 70.3% for female.This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%, 27% and 9%.

                    <br>
                    <h3> Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h3>
                    Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans. Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video.When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth.Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence include mimicking human cognitive activity. Researchers and developers in the field are making surprisingly rapid strides in mimicking activities such as learning, reasoning, and perception, to the extent that these can be concretely defined. Some believe that innovators may soon be able to develop systems that exceed the capacity of humans to learn or reason out any subject. But others remain skeptical because all cognitive activity is laced with value judgments that are subject to human experience.

                    <h3> Information Technology (IT) </h3>	
                    Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used in the context of business operations, as opposed to technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.The Harvard Business Review coined the term information technology to make a distinction between purpose-built machines designed to perform a limited scope of functions, and general-purpose computing machines that could be programmed for various tasks. As the IT industry evolved from the mid-20th century, computing capability increased, while device cost and energy consumption decreased, a cycle that continues today when new technologies emerge.The IT department ensures that the organization's systems, networks, data and applications all connect and function properly. The IT team handles three major areas:
                    <br>
                    1. Deploys and maintains business applications, services and infrastructure (servers, networks, storage);
                    <br>
                    2. Monitors, optimizes and troubleshoots the performance of applications, services and infrastructure; and
                       oversees the security and governance of applications, services and infrastructure.

                    The princess revolution continues with Disney+’s Sneakerella, which is a modern day gender-flip of the classic Cinderella story. The movie is also racially and culturally diverse, something that is thankfully becoming more and more the norm as Disney continues to course-correct decades of only featuring young, white princesses. El (Chosen Jacobs) is a teen living in Queens who dreams of being a sneaker designer. “He grew up believing that the perfect pair of kicks could make him fly,” his neighbor/soon-to-be Fairy Godfather Gustavo (Juan Chioran) narrates. El lives above his family’s shoe store, Laces, with his stepfather Trey (Bryan Terrell Clark) and his step-brothers Stacy (Hayward Leach) and Zelly (Kolton Stewart). Trey makes El work at the store while Stacy and Zelly, who, in one of the movie’s more fun jokes, dream of returning to New Jersey, get to practice Judo and attend future venture capitalist meetings. “Enough is enough. Sometimes you just gotta let your dreams go,” Trey tells El. While in line to buy the latest sneaker from former basketball-player-turned-sneaker-mogul Darius King (John Salley), El and his best friend Sami (Devyn Nekoda) meet Kira (Lexi Underwood). Little does El know that Kira is actually the daughter of—wait for it—Darius King. She’s a real-life sneaker princess. What are the odds? Jacobs is a delightful screen presence full of charisma and amazing moves. Underwood, who can also currently be seen as Malia Obama in Showtime’s The First Lady, is equally delightful. Kira is a young woman figuring out where she fits in. The storyline itself, though, is thin as it tries to retrofit the Cinderella fairytale into this modern version. There are plot points that don’t make a lot of sense. But you’re coming for the singing and the phenomenal dancing. As a tween musical full of catchy songs, the shoe fits.

                    In 1954, cartoonist Brad Anderson made comic strip history by sketching out an anarchic, dopey Great Dane, whom he named Marmaduke. In the decades since, people loved Marmaduke for all of the obvious reasons: His slapstick adventures are effortlessly funny, his I-just-want-to-do-good ethos is naturally endearing and his inherent silliness embodies a kind of freedom to which we all aspire. But more than that, people love Marmaduke because his misgivings are reliable—predictable, even. And that’s exactly why adapting this character into a film will always be a complicated venture. How, exactly, do you turn that repetition into something that’s consistently engaging while still staying true to its delightful, humdrum essence? This is the challenge facing director Mark A.Z. Dippé as he resuscitates the mischievous pooch a decade after a famous cinematic flop. Dippé’s computer-animated film stars Pete Davidson as Marmaduke, the well-intentioned Great Dane who just can’t seem to get it right! Within the first few minutes, he finds himself committing a healthy number of faux pas, not least of which is cannonballing into a swimming pool to escape a bee, flooding his neighborhood, and subsequently wrecking his brother’s birthday party. What filmmakers seem to have overlooked over the past couple decades is that a story like Marmaduke begs for a new perspective; audiences are craving more nuance than sweet simple comforts. And while Dippé’s Marmaduke is a fun enough viewing experience, it doesn’t bring anything new to the table. Why can’t we just leave Marmaduke in the dog house for a little while?

                    <br>
                    The Ministry of Railways has announced that it’s going to collaborate with IIT Madras for the development of a made-in-India Hyperloop system. It has also announced that it’ll be setting up a Centre for Excellence for Hyperloop technologies at the aforementioned institution. India has shown interest in Hyperloop tech since 2017, by then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu. In fact, the ministry also held talks with US-based Hyperloop One, but nothing quite materialised.IIT Madras’s Avishkar Hyperloop which was formed in 2017 had been working on scalability and frugal engineering concepts for the development of a Hyperloop based transportation system for India. The group was one of the top ten finalists at the SpaceX Hyperloop Pod competition of 2019 and was the only Asian team to do so. They also were awarded the ‘Most Scalable Design Award’ at the European Hyperloop Week in 2021.Fast forward to March 2022, the institution approached the Ministry of Railways with a proposal for collaborative working on a prototype as well as the development of a first-of-its-kind Hyperloop Test facility at its Discovery campus located at Thaiyur, Tamil Nadu.

                    <h3> Five year plans of India: All you Need to Know </h3>
                    <br>
                    Five-Year Plans (FYPs) are national economic programmes that are controlled and integrated. In 1928, Joseph Stalin implemented the Soviet Union’s first Five-Year Plan. Most communist countries and a few capitalist ones have since adopted them. Under the socialist influence of India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, India established its First FYP in 1951, shortly after independence.The Indian economy was built on planning from 1947 to 2017. The Planning Commission, which lasted from 1951 to 2014 and the NITI Aayog from 2015 to 2017, established, implemented, and oversaw the Five-Year Plans. The commission has a nominated deputy chairman who holds the position of cabinet minister, with the prime minister serving as ex-officio chairman. The last deputy chairman of the commission is Montek Singh Ahluwalia. In March of 2017, the Twelfth Plan came to an end.
